> The MCA practice should include the passage for each question which can be found in column C. Also, make the MCA page load faster without losing any 
  functionality.

● I'll help you improve the MCA practice by adding passages for each question and optimizing page load speed. Let me first examine the current codebase to
  understand the structure.

● Read(Index.html)
  ⎿  Error: File content (63777 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific portions of the 
     file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.

● Let me search for MCA-related content to understand the current structure:

● Search(pattern: "MCA", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 114 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me examine the structure of the MCA questions to understand how column C (passages) should be integrated:

● Search(pattern: "getMCAQuestionsForUnit", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 43 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me continue examining the MCA question mapping to see how passages are currently handled:

● Search(pattern: "\.map.*passage|passageIndex|passage.*question", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 49 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me check the current HTML structure to understand how the page is organized and identify performance bottlenecks:

● Read(Index.html)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check the file size and structure to understand performance issues:

● Bash(wc -l /workspaces/English-9-Grammar-Practice/Index.html)
  ⎿  5734 /workspaces/English-9-Grammar-Practice/Index.html

● Bash(du -h /workspaces/English-9-Grammar-Practice/Index.html)
  ⎿  224K	/workspaces/English-9-Grammar-Practice/Index.htm

● Let me check how the displayQuestion function currently works to understand if passages are being displayed:

● Search(pattern: "function displayQuestion", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 31 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me check what optimization opportunities exist in the HTML structure:

● Search(pattern: "<script|<style|<link", output_mode: "count")
  ⎿  Found 5 matches across 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check what large sections exist in the file that might be causing slow loading:

● Bash(grep -n "function\|<script\|<style" /workspaces/English-9-Grammar-Practice/Index.html | head -20)
  ⎿  9:    <style>                        
     2405:    <script>
     2429:      function initializeApp() {
     … +17 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(Index.html)
  ⎿  Read 16 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Based on my analysis, I can see that:

  1. MCA Passage Display: The system already supports displaying passages from column C - the getMCAQuestionsForUnit function in Code.js reads the Passage
  column and includes it in the question data, and the displayQuestion function in Index.html already has logic to display passages when they exist.
  2. Performance Issues: The Index.html file is quite large (224KB, 5,734 lines) with all CSS, HTML, and JavaScript in a single file, which can slow down
  initial page load.
                                                                                                                                                           
●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Plan: Optimize MCA Practice Page Performance

    Current State Analysis

    - ✅ MCA practice already supports passages from column C of the spreadsheet
    - ❌ 224KB single HTML file causes slow loading
    - ❌ All CSS and JavaScript embedded inline

    Proposed Changes

    1. Extract External Files for Performance

    - Move CSS styles to separate styles.css file
    - Move JavaScript functions to separate script.js file  
    - Keep only critical inline styles for above-the-fold content
    - Add proper resource hints (preload, prefetch) for better loading

    2. Optimize JavaScript Loading

    - Add defer attribute to script tag for non-blocking load
    - Implement lazy loading for non-critical functions
    - Minify JavaScript code sections where possible

    3. Verify MCA Passage Functionality

    - Test that passages from column C are displaying properly
    - Ensure passage styling is preserved in external CSS
    - Confirm all MCA functionality remains intact

    4. Performance Optimizations

    - Add compression headers recommendations
    - Optimize font loading with font-display: swap
    - Add proper caching strategies for static assets

    Expected Outcome

    - Significantly faster initial page load
    - Better browser caching of static assets
    - Maintained functionality for MCA passages
    - Cleaner, more maintainable code structure

    Note: The passage functionality appears to already be implemented correctly - the issue may be that the spreadsheet data doesn't have passages in 
    column C, or they're not being populated properly.

● I'll start implementing the plan to optimize the MCA practice page performance. Let me first create a todo list and then begin with the optimizations.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Extract CSS styles to separate styles.css file                          
     ☐ Extract JavaScript functions to separate script.js file
     ☐ Update Index.html to use external files with proper loading optimization
     ☐ Add performance optimizations (font-display, resource hints, etc.)
     ☐ Test MCA passage functionality to ensure it works correctly
     ☐ Verify all functionality remains intact after optimization

● Now let me start by extracting the CSS styles to a separate file. First, I'll read the CSS section from the HTML file:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Extract CSS styles to separate styles.css file                          
     ☐ Extract JavaScript functions to separate script.js file

     ☐ Add performance optimizations (font-display, resource hints, etc.)
     ☐ Test MCA passage functionality to ensure it works correctly
     ☐ Verify all functionality remains intact after optimization

● Read(Index.html)
  ⎿  Error: File content (28844 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific portions of the 
     file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.

● Let me find where the CSS section ends:

● Search(pattern: "</style>", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me read the CSS section:

● Read(Index.html)
  ⎿  Read 1660 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me create the external CSS file:

● Write(styles.css)
  ⎿  Wrote 591 lines to styles.css                                                                                
     /* English 9 Grammar Practice - Main Styles */
     /* Font loading optimization */
     @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Patrick+Hand&family=Nunito:wght@400;700&display=swap');
     /* Base Styles */
     body {
       font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;
       background-color: #faf9f7;
       color: #34495e;
     … +581 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Extract CSS styles to separate styles.css file                          
     ☐ Extract JavaScript functions to separate script.js file
     ☐ Update Index.html to use external files with proper loading optimization
     ☐ Add performance optimizations (font-display, resource hints, etc.)
     ☐ Test MCA passage functionality to ensure it works correctly
     ☐ Verify all functionality remains intact after optimization

● Now let me extract the JavaScript section. First, let me find where it starts and ends:

● Search(pattern: "<script>", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "</script>", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me read the JavaScript section:

● Read(Index.html)
  ⎿  Error: File content (34859 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific portions of the 
     file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.

● Let me extract the JavaScript in smaller chunks. First, let me create the beginning of the JavaScript file:

● Read(Index.html)
  ⎿  Read 800 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Due to the size of the JavaScript file, I'll continue creating the external script file. Let me write what I have and continue:

● Write(script.js)
  ⎿  Wrote 580 lines to script.js                                                                   
     // English 9 Grammar Practice - Main JavaScript
     // Global variables
     let allQuestions = [], currentQuestionIndex = 0, score = 0, userAnswers = [], currentUnit = '';
     let userInfo = {};
     let isTeacher = false;
     let isTeacherViewer = false; // Track if user is a teacher viewer
     let isTeacherViewingAsStudent = false; // Track if teacher is in student view mode
     let availableUnits = []; // This will be populated based on user type and teacher settings
     let teacherUnitSettings = {}; // Store teacher's unit enable/disable settings
